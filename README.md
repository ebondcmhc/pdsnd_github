### Project Title
Udacity Bike Share data analysis in R

### Description
This project uses R to analyse bike share data across three cities:  Chicago, New York, and Washington.  The program reads in the data and generates visualizations to explore three questions:

* How do trip durations compare between cities?
* What types of user are most common in each city?
* How do trip durations vary by type of user?
